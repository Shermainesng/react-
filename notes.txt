vscode settings (settings.json)
- setting up JS files into Javascript react files automatically
- adding Prettier + add in some settings

create a package.json file
- npm init-y
- npm install react react-dom
- npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server (to compile and transpile JSX into JS code that browsers can understand)

npm webpack.config.js
- filename of the newly bundled file is bundled.js
- in index.html, <script src = "/bundled.js"></script>
- npm run dev and then go to localhost:3000

adding routing (Main.js)
- import {BrowserRouter,Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom'
- add routes into code in the function in Main.js
- in the footer that contains links to all the different routes,
   - import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'
   - change <a> to <Link>
   - change <href> to <to>

setting up a container for each page to keep width consistent (Container.js)
- using ternary operator to give a different class depending on current size of each page's content
- <HouseGuest> needs a wider container, so a larger container is rendered
- <About> and <Terms> need a smaller container, so smaller one is rendered

setting up tab name for each webpage (must set up manually for client-side rendering)
- eg when i click on 'about us' page, i want the tab to be changed to 'About Us'
- create a Page component, and use useEffect do render document title
- can import Container into the Page component too.
- just give a <Page title=''> and name title for each of the page where we want the tabs to be changed
